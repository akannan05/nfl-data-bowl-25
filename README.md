# Utility Maximization/Minimization in NFL Football

NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 Project. Animesh Joshi and Anirudh "Ani" Kannan.

Utility functions are functions that define the satisfaction a particular good provides to a customer. Utility functions can also be applied to activities and actions to define the satisfaction or utility that carrying out an action may have for the party involved. In the case of criminal justice, the utility function of a crime is defined as the probability of getting caught comitting that crime multiplied by the severity of the punishment. In international relations, the utility function of a threat used in deterrence or compellence is the probability of threat execution multiplied by the severity of a threat. Using this domain knowledge, we can define the utility function of a football pass play as the probability of a completion multiplied by the expected yardage gain of that play. This function will define the satisfaction or "utility" that a pass play has for an offensive team. The goal of the offense is to maximize this utility function while the goal of the defense is to minimize this utility function. This project will investigate how this utility function changes across different pass coverages and based on pre snap motion, and it will also investigate the marginal utility of defensive players under different coverage schemes and motions. The insights can be used by both offensive and defensive teams to optimize their approach to executing or defending against passing plays in the NFL.
